As well as the thesis PDF, the modelling framework I developed for the PhD is included here. Built in Java, this linked an agent-based spatial economic model to a data framework and a set of interactive visualisation tools. The visualisation tools are designed to produce publication-quality outputs as well as being used to help explore model dymnamics. [Here's an example](bit.ly/1sppUhW) of their use in a publication (PDF).

Files and folders in the model code zip:

"CoreModel" folder: contains runnable jar for the core model version in section 2.5. Instructions on "readme.txt" file in the folder

"FrameWorkModelBuilds" folder: contains a series of runnable jar files for thesis models. "listOfModels.txt" explains them and links to the sections of the thesis they appear in.

"EoS_vs_LoV_ExcelModel_DanOlner2013web.xlsx": spreadsheet version of the `transmission belt' mechanism, section 6.3.4.

"exchangetestrandom": Matlab file for the random money exchange example, section 4.7.2.
